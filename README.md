COMP 371 Project 

This project consists of making a Procedural World using the OpenGL libraries of C++.

	CONTROLS

- The mouse is used to pan around the city. the focus is permanently set on the Play Window so there's no need to worry about focus.

- The mouse wheel is used to set the camera distance. It is very sensitive and if one scrolls too far it will invert the world. Use with caution. 

- The user uses the "W", "S", "A" and "D" keys to move about the city with respect to the camera angle.

	- The "W" key is used to move forward.
	- The "S" key is used to move backward.
	- The "A" key is used to move left.
	- The "D" key is used to move right.


//Not working

- The user can press "G" to enable fog and "O" to disable it
